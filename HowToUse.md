# Short description of how to use ocdlog #

OcdLog consists of two applications at the moment

  1. ocdlog.app
  1. grabscreen.app

Just put the applications where you want them (e.g. in /Applications or ~/Applications) and run them. _ocdlog.app_ asks for a log entry every 15 minutes and _grabscreen.app_ takes a screenshot of your desktop every 8-10 seconds. Data is stored in ~/Documents/ocdlog
