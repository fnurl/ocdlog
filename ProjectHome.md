I created the separate applications in this project to help me keep track of what I do with my days infront of my computer. I have quite a few areas of responsibility and all of them require me to use my computer. Lately (or maybe for as long as I can remember) I have had a hard time "doing what I am supposed to be doing". Maybe because that in it self is not defined. Anyway, I tried a lot of methodologies, but they have not worked out perfectly. To be able to debug the reason why they have not worked out for me, I decided that I need to log what I am actually doing at my computer. This is the result of that attempt.

ocdlog is for Mac OS X (I use Leopard but I think it should be Tiger compatible).

**Requirements** (in addition to AppleScript, Python)
  * Image Magick

At the moment ocdlog takes screenshots at regular intervals of the desktop + asks for a activity message every 15 minutes. I am however working on annotating the screenshots with the log messages and also combining the annotated screenshots into a movie. The movie is the ultimate goal as this will enable quick daily reviews.
